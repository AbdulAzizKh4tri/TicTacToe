# Tic Tac Toe
you know what a tic-tac-toe is.

## Features
- you can lose (optional)
- you can win (sometimes)
- you can be in a tie
- you don't have to bother reloading the page after the game is finished (which a certain someone thought wasn't a great feature)


## Future Plans
currently empty (like my soul).
